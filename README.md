# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

This project aims to develop a system that detects driver drowsiness in real-time. The system utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to monitor the driver's eyes, face, and head position to identify signs of drowsiness and alert the driver.

## Features
- Real-time drowsiness detection using webcam or camera feed.
- Eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculation to detect blink frequency and eye closure.
- Alert system to notify the driver when drowsiness is detected.
- Can be integrated with vehicles for real-world applications.

## Installation
